#Introduction to programming with python

What can I do with programming? How can it help me with my business? How do I learn to program?

This workshop will introduce a programming language called 'python', show examples of what can be done with it and provide a gentle introduction with hands on examples.

This workshop is aimed at beginners with little or no prior programming experience.
Entrepreneurs, students or just the curious are all welcome.

The workshop will be given in English, with translation into Spanish.

We particularly want to encourage women to attend, to improve the diversity of the software community.

This talk/workshop was given in Medellin Colombia on Saturday 24th of February
